# CliFin
CliFin is a Python framework designed for assessing financial risks in a variety of investment assets in response to climate change.
The framework is divided into three main parts. 
1. **CliFin Core** : Embedded domain-specific language (DSL) that allows you to dynamically adapt your model without manual intervention
2. **CliFin infra** : Performing cash flow projections, risk factor reflection, and asset valuation.
3. **Datasets** for various types of assets and climate scenario analysis to perform CliFin infra.
   
## What features CliFin can provide?
CliFin offers several advanced features specifically designed to address the complexities of climate-related financial risk assessment:

**Flexible and Extensible Modeling** : CliFin uses a Python-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that allows for dynamic model adjustments. This flexibility makes it easy to adapt financial models to different climate scenarios and risk factors. 

**Climate Scenario Testing** : The framework supports simulation and financial analysis across a variety of IPCC climate scenarios, such as SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585. This feature enables financial institutions and investors to evaluate how different climate scenarios could impact their assets and portfolios.

**Bankability Assessment** : CliFin provides comprehensive tools to assess the bankability of infrastructure projects under varying climate conditions. By integrating financial metrics such as Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) with climate scenario analyses, CliFin helps determine whether projects are financially viable and capable of securing funding.
